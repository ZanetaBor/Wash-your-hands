**Status:**  In development  
**Technology:** Blazor WebAssembly, C#  
**Target:** Educational / Awareness game for children and adults

##  About the Project

This project is an **educational browser game** built with **Blazor WebAssembly** that aims to **raise awareness about hand hygiene**
and the importance of preventing infections through proper practices.

The game simulates how **bacteria and viruses spread**, and how elements like **soap, dirt, antibiotics, 
and vaccines** interact in a visual and engaging way. By presenting this in a fun and interactive form, 
goal is to **encourage healthy habits**, especially among children.

##  Current Status

The game is currently in the **early development phase**, being built iteratively based on project goals and instructor feedback. 
It is **not yet feature-complete** and is being actively improved.

This repository will serve as a **portfolio project**, with clean code, commits, and clear architecture showcasing my work in **C# and Blazor**.
